# Github battle
- App has 2 main functionalities:
1. Displays the most popular repositories based on programming language.
2. Allows you to fill in 2 Github usernames and checks who has a better Github score based an the users's amount of followers, amount of repositories etc.
- Project is build on [this boilerplate](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter).
- Initial project was written only in React. After gaining experience in Redux, I refactored so it also includes Redux.
- Notes in relation to this project can be found throughout my [React cheatsheet folder](https://github.com/silksil/best-practices-cheatsheets/tree/master/client/react).
